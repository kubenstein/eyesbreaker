Eyesbreaker
=============

Eyesbreaker is a simple script that remindes you, vocaly and by system notifications, that you should take a short break from looking at your computer screen.


Details
-------
Every 10 minutes system notifications will pop, as well as voice notification. Next, after 10 seconds, next round of notifications will inform you that break is over. Due to voice notification you don't have to look at computer screen to know when break is over. You can look around, or close your yes, or do any other eyes gymnastics.
